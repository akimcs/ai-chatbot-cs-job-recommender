                Great! Try to answer my questions with either a "yes" or "no". 
                To start off, are you a computer science major?
                <think>
                    <set name = "topic">csmajor</set>

	            So you aren't a computer science major, got it. 
	            Are you comfortable with coding?
	            <think>

                That's cool! Since you are a computer science major, 
                do you like coding?
                <think>

	            Since you aren't a cs major and also don't like coding, 
	            you should look into a career as a UI/UX Designer!
